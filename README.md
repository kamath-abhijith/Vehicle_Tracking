# VEHICLE DETECTION AND TRACKING

Vehicle detection and tracking for automated driving test. Vehicle detection at the entry and exit of the course is designed using constant detection rate (CDR) and constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) Neymann-Pearson detectors. Vehicle tracking estimation is done using Kalman filter. The repository contains Python3 scripts for:

- CDR Neymann-Pearson detector,
- CFAR Neymann-Pearson detector,
for detection, and,
- Kalman Filter,
for vehicle tracking.
